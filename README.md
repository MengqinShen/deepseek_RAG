# deepseek_RAG
Using deepseek to build a local ChatBot, given a PDF document as knowledge base , ask questions and get answers from the bot.
Before use this RAG, you need to install Ollama and the libaries from requirement file, also remember to pull the OllamaEmbeddings models(in this case, "nomic-embed-text" was used)
For a 16GB RAM, it's okay to use deepseek-r1:8b model. 16b model will make it very slow.
